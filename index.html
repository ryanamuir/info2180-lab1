        <p>I am a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at the University of the West Indies, currently learning about HTML, CSS and version control in the Dynamic Web Development 1 course, otherwise known as INFO2180, in the Faculty of Science & Technology. I look forward to learning more about Web Development, as it could greatly improve my efficiency and effectiveness while working on personal projects.</p>
